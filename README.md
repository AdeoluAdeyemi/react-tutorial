# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Tutorial

I learnt React fundamentals including Components, States, and Props. I also learnt how to ensure a component is added to the dom before calling an api using the JavaScript Vanilla fetch method.
